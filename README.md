# Annex-A-Code-availability
PH4421 FYP project (Annex A): This file consists of the codes used to plot and simulate my SIR deterministic ODE and stochastic complex networks (with HOIs) models. I've used M = 5000 simulations for my experiment but in my codes only showed for  M = 50 due to long run time. However, if you use the seeds I set, you will get back my result

Somehow the GITHUB serve is temporarily down
